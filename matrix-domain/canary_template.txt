# anontier.nl Canary and Transparency Report #REPORT NUMBER

## This letter is digitally signed on UTC time: CURRENT DATE

Roughly every week, a new Transparency report will be created. If it has been more than two weeks since the last signed message, unless otherwise noted, you should assume something is wrong. You can also request a signed message personally any day I'm on.

Delays are always possible, like with major holidays or vacations. Those will be mentioned in the previous report with when to expect the next report.
