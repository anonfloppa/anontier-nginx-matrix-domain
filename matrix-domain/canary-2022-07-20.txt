New Updates:

The server was shut down by our VPS for maintenance for 2 hours on July 17th at 10PM PST. It was not supposed to impact our services but it did. Here is the response from their customer support:

Hello *******, apologies for the issues you've been experiencing,

This could have affected your service in some way we haven't expected and which we are still investigating, but the maintenance should be complete at this point - if you continue to see any problems, please let us know
