Hello,


I am aware of the room and have spoke with the admin of the room and they deny allowing obscene images of children, including those clothed and unclothed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_test. Could you supply your evidence with screenshots, event_id's, timestamps, and/or sender keys?


Thank you

The room routinely has content posted to it that under US law would be classified as child porn due to the context of the images, even though the children are clothed. Furthermore, actual cp is posted to the room and while it is a "bannable" offense the admin of the room tacitly implies it is approved of by calling those posting pedophilic content, 'madlads'.
