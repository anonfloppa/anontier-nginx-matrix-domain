Roughly every week, a new Transparency report will be created. If it has been more than two weeks since the last signed message, unless otherwise noted, you should assume something is wrong. You can also request a signed message personally any day I'm on.

An archive of reports is available at: https://anontier.nl/archive.html

Delays are always possible, like with major holidays or vacations. Those will be mentioned in the previous report with when to expect the next report.

Since the creation of anontier, we have received the following:

Number of court orders: 0
Number of legal copyright-related complaints: 0
Number of law enforcement requests or demands: 0
Amount of information shared with a third-party: 0
Number of known security breaches, including data leaks, of user data: 0

Since the last canary, have the above numbers changed? No

There has never been a National Security Letter or gag-order sent to anontier.nl. Nor is there anything important otherwise that anontier is being prevented from mentioning.


New Updates: 
With the last report, we discussed in the meta room some changes that would be in the next report to remove some of the vagueness. The new format is above. You can message @bosscat or mention it in the meta room if you have any concerns. 
We have a new Monero address for donations below. 
Files that have not been accessed for multiple weeks were purged last week due to an emergency lack of space. Deleting files that have not been accessed for 2 months will be the new standard.  You are welcome to request an exemption for the files you upload.
