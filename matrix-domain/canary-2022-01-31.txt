Roughly every week, a new Transparency report will be created. If it has been more than two weeks since the last signed message, unless otherwise noted, you should assume something is wrong. You can also request a signed message personally any day I'm on.

An archive of reports is available at: https://anontier.nl/archive.html

Delays are always possible, like with major holidays or vacations. Those will be mentioned in the previous report with when to expect the next report.

Since the creation of anontier, we have received the following:

Number of court orders: 0
Number of legal copyright-related complaints: 0
Number of law enforcement requests or demands: 0
Amount of information shared with a third-party: 0
Number of known security breaches, including data leaks, of user data: 0

Since the last canary, have the above numbers changed? No

There has never been a National Security Letter or gag-order sent to anontier.nl. Nor is there anything important otherwise that anontier is being prevented from mentioning.


New Updates: 
- From about Wednesday to Friday this week we were down about 90% of the time due to a DDoS attack. We switched as soon as we could to a ddos protected ip. At no point during this attack was anyone's personal data compromised or at an increased risk of being compromised. Since switching, everything has been stable. We now have an external page on poast, https://poa.st/@anontier, for any emergency updates should our server be down for an extended period of time.
