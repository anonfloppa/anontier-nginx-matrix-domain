New Updates: 
Significant improvements in terms of performance. A complexity filter was set for rooms that are too complex. Large rooms with many unique homeservers can cause federating issues and it has made a noticable difference. This should not affect anything on the public room list. If something is being blocked that you feel should not, message @bosscat:anontier.nl.
